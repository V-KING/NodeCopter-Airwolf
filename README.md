NodeCopter-Airwolf
==================

### WHAT?

Airwolf - a hacky HTML5 Dashboard for the AR-Drone2. 

Features:
* Flight Controls
* Realtime video feed
* Realtime Telemetry from the Drone

This app is based heavily on the work of
https://github.com/remy/drone-record and https://github.com/bkw/node-dronestream

This project also includes code/ideas from the following projects:

https://github.com/felixge/node-ar-drone

https://github.com/mbebenita/Broadway 

https://github.com/rheh/HTML5-canvas-projects

https://github.com/seannicholls/NodeCopter-Clarice


### WHY?

There was an existing video streaming app, and an existing control app, but no one had combined the two ideas to our knowledge.

### WHERE AND WHEN?

This app was created for MiniNodeCopter SF on Oct 31, 2012. Go Giants.

### HOW?

git clone git@github.com:jbrass/NodeCopter-Airwolf.git

cd NodeCopter-Airwolf

npm install

node server.js

The app runs on port 3000. Port 4000, is also used for Socket.io traffic to relay flight controls.
